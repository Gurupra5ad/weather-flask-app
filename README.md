30 DAY Challenge - DAY 14

As a part of day 14 challenge in my 30 days = 30 projects challenge, I made a live time weather display site using flask framework. Here the user has to enter the city name and country name after which the website will fetch live weather, humidity and wind speed data from an API and the details will be displayed.
